# Algorithms For 351

This is a repo full of the algorithms we discuss in CMSC351 implemented in Ruby because thats what I felt like writing today

:shrug:

The algorithms are as follows:

1.  Bubble Sort
2.  Kadane Algorithm
3.  Kadane Part II 
4.  Selection Sort
5.  Insertion Sort
6.  Binary Search
7. 	Merge Sort
8.  Heap Sort & Max Heapify
9.  Quick Sort

How to run an algorithm example:
```Bash
ruby bubble.rb
```
